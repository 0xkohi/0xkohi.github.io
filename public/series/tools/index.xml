      <description>Context I decided to create a Discord bot that could be useful, for me and maybe for some people. The bot has many use cases, on my side I will use it in malware analysis and has a threat intelligence news. Since I am often using discord, using this bot is also a faster way to get the information I need.&#xA;Bot Features The bot currently has 4 features, more might be added in the future if I get other ideas.</description>
