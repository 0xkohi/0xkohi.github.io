      <description>Context I decided to create a Discord bot that could be useful, for me and maybe for some people. The bot has many use cases, on my side I will use it in malware analysis and has a threat intelligence news. Since I am often using discord, using this bot is also a faster way to get the information I need.&#xA;Bot Features The bot currently has 4 features, more might be added in the future if I get other ideas.</description>

      <description>Context I executed Thanos Ransomware on a VM to analyze its behavior and to better understand how general ransomware are working. I decided to choose this one because most of the others can adapt themselves to a sandbox environment and so are not executing properly. Thanos Ransomware is also able to do it but since it is a ransomware-as-a-service, I found a sample in which the “Anti-VM” option was not enabled.</description>
